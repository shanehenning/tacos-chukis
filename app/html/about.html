      <h2>HOW A BICYCLE TRIP TURNED INTO THE BEST TACOS IN SEATTLE</h2>
      <p>
        Roberto Salmer√≥n had done it--he'd graduated from the University of Washington. But that accomplishment was swiftly brushed aside by the burning question: "What now?"
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a question that many recent grads ask themselves. And to help discern his future, Roberto--like many recent grads--returned to his past. To be more precise, he embarked on an epic, 1,700-mile bicycle journey to his hometown of Tijuana, Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately upon arriving home, his family welcomed him with open arms, beaming smiles, and tacos. Roberto had discovered the answer to the question of "What now?" In all his time in Seattle, he'd never been able to find the delicious taqueria fare he
        had grown up with and he, wisely, mused that if he loved this food so much, so would others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roberto started Tacos Chukis in 2011 and it has been on a journey of its ever own since, unhaltingly working its way into the hearts (and bellies) of Seattleites. Tucked away in a modern-day hole-in-the-wall in Capitol Hill, Tacos Chukis has become many
        people's secret spot to satisfy their taco cravings.
